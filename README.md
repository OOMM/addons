Automatically tracks procs for weapon enchants, set bonuses, rings, and trinkets. Add new buff tracking by adding the following under the appropriate spec to Spells.lua
```lua
DEOSpells["Nightmare Fire"] = { 
  spid = 162919, 
  itemid = 112320, 
  cd = 115, 
  originType = "equipment" 
}
```
